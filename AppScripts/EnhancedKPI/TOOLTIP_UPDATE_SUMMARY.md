## What Users Will See

When hovering over any KPI card, users now see:

1. **Clear Definition** - What the metric is
2. **Calculation Formula** - Exact calculation method
3. **Data Sources** - Which sheets and fields are used
4. **Business Significance** - Why it matters
5. **Quality Benchmarks** - Target values where applicable
6. **Interpretation Guidance** - How to understand the numbers

## Example Tooltip (Predictive CLV)

**Before:**
> "Estimated total future value per customer. Formula: ARPU / Churn Rate. Shows expected lifetime revenue."

**After:**
> "Estimated total FUTURE lifetime value per customer. Formula: ARPU / (Churn Rate / 100). Example: If ARPU = $200/month and Churn = 5% (0.05), then CLV = $200 / 0.05 = $4,000 expected lifetime revenue. Strategic metric for determining maximum acceptable Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)."
