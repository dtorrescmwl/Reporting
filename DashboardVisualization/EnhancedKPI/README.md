# Enhanced KPI Dashboard Development

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains the complete specification and implementation plan for an Enhanced KPI Dashboard that addresses critical flaws in the existing healthcare business intelligence system using only available data. The primary focus is fixing unrealistic Customer Lifetime Value calculations and implementing scientifically sound business metrics with data from Database_CarePortals.xlsx.

**Data Source**: `Database_CarePortals.xlsx` (5,100+ records across 16 sheets)
**Primary Enhancement**: Accurate cohort-based LTV calculation replacing flawed simple formula
**Target Users**: Healthcare executives, clinical teams, and subscription business stakeholders

## 🚨 Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) - Complete Redesign ⭐ **PRIMARY FIX**
**Current Problem**: Formula `LTV = ARPU / Churn Rate` produces unrealistic values ($3,231+)
**Root Causes**:
- Treats annual churn rate as monthly
- Ignores customer behavior patterns
- No consideration of customer lifecycle data
- Produces values 5-10x higher than realistic healthcare subscription LTV

**Enhanced Solution**: Scientific cohort-based LTV using available customer and payment data
- Realistic value range: $150-$800 for healthcare subscriptions
- Cohort retention curve analysis using subscription data
- Customer revenue tracking using payment records
- Statistical validation with available data confidence

### 2. Visualization Quality Issues
**Current Problems**:
- Poor chart readability and inconsistent design
- No interactive features for drill-down analysis
- Mobile responsiveness issues
- Unprofessional appearance for executive presentation

**Enhanced Solutions**:
- Professional Chart.js configurations with healthcare industry standards
- Interactive tooltips and drill-down capabilities
- Executive-quality visualizations suitable for board presentations
- Consistent color palette and branding

### 3. Churn Rate Calculation Inconsistencies
**Current Problem**: Inconsistent methodology producing unreliable rates
**Enhanced Solution**: Proper cohort-based churn with standardized time periods

## 📊 LTV Calculation Enhancement Details (Using Available Data)

### Current Flawed Formula
```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC: Current calculation
function calculateLTV(arpu, churnRate) {
  return arpu / (churnRate / 100); // Produces $3,231+ unrealistic values
}
```

### Enhanced Scientific Formula (Available Data Only)
```javascript
// ENHANCED: Cohort-based LTV calculation using Database_CarePortals data
function calculateRealisticLTV(customers, orders, payments, subscriptions) {
  const cohorts = groupCustomersByCohort(customers, orders);
  let weightedLTV = 0;
  let totalCustomers = 0;

  cohorts.forEach(cohort => {
    // Calculate revenue per cohort using payment data
    const cohortRevenue = payments.filter(payment =>
      orders.some(order =>
        order.order_id === payment.order_number &&
        cohort.customerIds.includes(order.customer_id)
      )
    ).reduce((sum, payment) => sum + (parseFloat(payment.amount) || 0), 0);

    // Calculate average lifespan using subscription data
    const avgLifespan = calculateAverageLifespan(cohort.customerIds, subscriptions);

    const cohortLTV = cohort.customerIds.length > 0 ?
      cohortRevenue / cohort.customerIds.length : 0;

    weightedLTV += cohortLTV * cohort.customerIds.length;
    totalCustomers += cohort.customerIds.length;
  });

  return totalCustomers > 0 ? weightedLTV / totalCustomers : 0;
  // Expected result: $150-$800 (realistic for healthcare)
}
```
