answers Object
The answers property is a dynamic object that holds a patient's responses to a questionnaire. The structure and content change based on the questions asked and the patient's answers.

Each key in the payload corresponds to a specific question, whose type can be identified. See the different types of answers below:

Single/Multi-Select: Answers are nested objects where the inner key indicates the chosen option, and the value is true.

"wlus_consentPregnancy": { "wlus_consentPregnancy_consent": true } 
Text Field: Answers are nested objects where the key is the question identifier and the value is the patient's text input.

"wlusFollowup_otherInformationOrQuestionsDoYouHaveForTheDoctor": { "wlusFollowup_otherInformationOrQuestionsDoYouHaveForTheDoctor": "None" } 
Calculated Fields: These objects contain raw, uncalculated values (e.g., height and weight) that are used to compute a final result like BMI. The format varies for each type of calculated field.

"wlus_weightAndHeight2025": { "weightUnit": "lbs", "weight": 169 } 
File Upload: The answer is a direct string that is a link to the uploaded file's location in the database. This link is not publicly accessible.

"govIdUs": "<https://appgen-health-crm-files>..." 
The wlusFollowup_ prefix is used to identify the specific questionnaire, distinguishing between overlapping questions that may have different versions across various questionnaires.

The answers payload is dynamic. Questions and their corresponding answers are only included if they were part of the patient's questionnaire and were answered. For example, male patients will not have a pregnancy consent question in their payload.
