# Current Spreadsheet Reporting - ACTUAL Implementation

## Overview - What You're Actually Doing

Your current Google Sheets setup is a **sophisticated data collection and processing infrastructure**, but **NOT an automated reporting system**. You're collecting comprehensive data across the healthcare customer journey, but the actual reporting analysis is done manually using the collected data.

## What Is Actually Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Data Collection** ✅ ACTIVE

**Cross-System Data Capture:**
- **Form Submissions**: Embeddables funnels → Google Sheets (46 fields collected)
- **Page Progression**: Real-time tracking of funnel progression (forward-only logging)  
- **Order Processing**: CarePortals orders → Multiple sheets (simple + normalized)
- **Prescription Tracking**: EMR prescriptions → Google Sheets
- **Subscription Lifecycle**: Pause/cancellation events → Google Sheets
- **Email Linking**: All systems use email as primary key for cross-system data matching

### 2. **Automated Data Processing** ✅ ACTIVE

**Data Quality and Transformation:**
- **Email Validation**: Banned domain filtering (`@cmwl.com`, test emails)
- **Data Formatting**: Height, date, state standardization
- **Address Normalization**: MD5 hashing for deduplication
- **Pharmacy Routing**: Automatic state-based assignment (SC/IN → Other)
- **Error Handling**: Failed webhook recovery and logging
- **GoHighLevel Integration**: Marketing automation tags based on form completion

### 3. **Data Infrastructure** ✅ ACTIVE

**Normalized Database Structure:**
- **Customer Deduplication**: Single customer record per email
- **Address Management**: MD5-hashed normalized addresses
- **Product Catalog**: Product information with pricing
- **Order Relationships**: Foreign key structure linking customers/addresses/products

## What You Can Currently Track (But Must Analyze Manually)

### 1. **Cross-System Customer Matching**
**Available Data**: Email addresses link customers across all systems
**Manual Analysis Required**: 
- Who submitted forms AND placed orders
- Time between form submission and purchase
- Conversion rates by funnel type
- Customer journey reconstruction

### 2. **Funnel Performance Analysis**  
**Available Data**: Page progression, form completions, checkout initiations
**Manual Analysis Required**:
- Drop-off rates at each page
- Funnel comparison (Medication vs. Semaglutide vs. Tirzepatide)
- Completion time analysis
- Geographic performance by state

### 3. **Medical Qualification Analysis**
**Available Data**: BMI, age, health conditions, disqualification reasons
**Manual Analysis Required**:
- Qualification success rates by demographics
- Common disqualification reasons
- Medical condition impact on conversions

### 4. **Order and Revenue Analysis**
**Available Data**: Order values, discounts, products, geographic data
**Manual Analysis Required**:
- Revenue by funnel type
- Average order values
- Discount effectiveness
- Geographic revenue patterns
- Pharmacy routing performance

### 5. **Subscription Lifecycle Tracking**
**Available Data**: Pause/cancellation events with customer details
**Manual Analysis Required**:
- Churn rates and timing
- Retention analysis
- Subscription duration patterns

## What Is NOT Actually Implemented

### ❌ **Automated Reporting/Calculations**
- **NO** automatic lifetime value calculations
- **NO** automated conversion rate reports  
- **NO** real-time dashboards
- **NO** automated cohort analysis
- **NO** automatic business intelligence reports
- **NO** performance metric calculations

### ❌ **Advanced Analytics Functions**
- **NO** cross-system joins automated in scripts
- **NO** statistical calculations in webhooks
- **NO** predictive analytics
- **NO** automated segmentation

## Your Current Manual Reporting Process

Based on the data infrastructure, you likely perform manual analysis by:

1. **Exporting Data**: Download data from spreadsheets
2. **Cross-System Matching**: Use email addresses to link customers across systems
3. **Manual Calculations**: Create formulas or pivot tables for metrics
4. **Customer Journey Analysis**: Track individual customer paths manually
5. **Performance Analysis**: Calculate conversion rates and trends manually

## Example of What You Can Currently Analyze Manually

**Customer Journey Analysis** (requires manual work):
```
Email: patient@example.com

Step 1: Find in submissions sheet
- Submitted: Semaglutide funnel on 2024-01-15
- Medical status: Qualified (BMI 32, age 45)
- Reached: Checkout page

Step 2: Find in order.created sheet  
- Ordered: 2024-01-18 ($199.99)
- Pharmacy: SevenCells (not SC/IN)

Step 3: Find in prescription.created sheet
- Prescription: Created 2024-01-19

Result: 3-day conversion, successful journey
```

**This analysis requires manual lookup and matching - not automated.**
